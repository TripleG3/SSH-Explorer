# SSH Explorer - Architecture Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the SSH Explorer application to strictly follow the MVVM/CIS pattern as specified in the new-feature.md document.

## Completed Changes

### ✅ 1. Folder Structure Reorganization
- **Pages/**: Created and moved navigation targets (MainPage, OptionsPage)
- **Views/**: Created for reusable UI components (SshConnectionToolbarView)  
- **Models/Services/**: Moved all service implementations from Services/ folder
- **Resources/**: Already properly organized with Styles, Converters, Fonts, Images, etc.

### ✅ 2. State Models - CIS Pattern Compliance
All state models now follow the CIS pattern with:
- Immutable record struct definitions
- Universal `IsBusy` boolean property
- Universal `ErrorMessage` string property
- Static `Empty` defaults

**Updated Models:**
- `Profile` - Converted from class to immutable record struct
- `SshConnectionState` - Already compliant
- `ProfileState` - Already compliant  
- `FileExplorerState` - Already compliant
- `TerminalState` - Already compliant
- `UiInteractionState` - Already compliant

### ✅ 3. Service Layer Refactoring
- All services moved to `Models/Services/` namespace
- All services implement `IStatePublisher<TState>` interface
- All async methods require `CancellationToken` parameter
- Services publish immutable state changes via StateChanged events

**Service Structure:**
```
Models/Services/
├── ISshService.cs & SshService.cs
├── IProfileService.cs & ProfileService.cs
├── IFileExplorerService.cs & FileExplorerService.cs
├── ITerminalService.cs & TerminalService.cs
├── IThemeService.cs & ThemeService.cs
├── IDialogService.cs & DialogService.cs
└── IUiInteractionService.cs & UiInteractionService.cs
```

### ✅ 4. ViewModels - Clean MVVM Implementation
- ViewModels only contain State properties and Commands
- Removed all UI-specific logic
- ViewModels bind to service state changes via PropertyChanged
- Commands use proper CanExecute binding

**ViewModel Pattern Example:**
```csharp
public sealed class SshConnectionToolbarViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    // State property combining service states
    public SshConnectionToolbarState State => new(/*...*/)
    
    // Commands only
    public ICommand ConnectCommand { get; }
    public ICommand DisconnectCommand { get; }
    // ...
}
```

### ✅ 5. Views - Reusable Components
- **Views/**: Contains reusable UI components
- **Pages/**: Contains navigation targets with thin layouts
- Views bind only to State property and Commands
- No code-behind except for constructor injection

**New View Example:**
- `SshConnectionToolbarView` - Extracted reusable toolbar component

### ✅ 6. Resources Organization
- **Resources/Styles/**: Global styles with clear naming
- **Resources/Converters/**: Ready for value converters
- **Resources/Fonts/**: Font resources
- **Resources/Images/**: Image assets
- All resources are global and clearly named

### ✅ 7. Dependency Injection Updates
Updated `MauiProgram.cs` to register:
- All service interfaces and implementations
- All ViewModels (both existing and new)
- All Pages and Views

### ✅ 8. Namespace Updates
- `SSHExplorer.Services` → `SSHExplorer.Models.Services`
- `SSHExplorer.Views` → `SSHExplorer.Pages` (for navigation targets)
- Added `SSHExplorer.Views` namespace for reusable components

## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Async/Await Pattern
- All async operations use async/await
- All async calls include CancellationToken parameter
- Proper error handling with immutable state updates

### ✅ MVVM/CIS Pattern
- **Models**: Immutable state records with IsBusy/ErrorMessage
- **Services**: IStatePublisher implementations with state management
- **ViewModels**: State and Commands only, no UI logic
- **Views**: Bind to State property and Commands only

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- **Pages**: Thin layout containers for navigation
- **Views**: Reusable UI components
- **ViewModels**: State and command binding layer
- **Models**: Business logic and data structures
- **Services**: State management and business operations

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully builds** with only minor XAML binding compilation warnings (performance optimizations)

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. Converted mutable Profile class to immutable record struct
2. Organized folder structure according to architectural principles
3. Removed UI logic from ViewModels
4. Created proper service abstraction layer
5. Implemented consistent async/CancellationToken pattern

## Remaining Questions/Considerations

### Questions for Final Implementation:
1. **Service Granularity**: Should we create more granular Views for file explorers (RemoteFileExplorerView, LocalFileExplorerView)?

2. **Converter Needs**: Are there any value converters needed for data transformation in Views?

3. **Navigation Strategy**: Should we implement a navigation service following the same CIS pattern?

4. **State Persistence**: Do we need to persist any additional state (beyond current profile persistence)?

5. **Error Handling**: Should error handling be centralized through a dedicated error service?

6. **Validation**: Do we need input validation services for forms/profiles?

The refactoring maintains all original functionality while enforcing the strict MVVM/CIS architectural pattern specified in the requirements.
